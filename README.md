Hand_Gesture_Game_Controller
Hand Gesture Game Controller that lets you play games using real-time hand movements via your webcam! No keyboard, no mouse—just AI-powered control with intuitive hand gestures. This project leverages MediaPipe and OpenCV to track index finger movements and translates them into arrow key inputs using PyAutoGUI. The left/right controls are reversed to match the mirrored camera view, ensuring a seamless experience.

Features
• Directional controls (Left, Right, Up, Down) via index finger swipes • Webcam-based gesture tracking • Reversed left/right control to match mirrored camera view • Easy integration with browser or offline games
